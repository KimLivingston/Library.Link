    "description": "Paul Tremblay is known for his psychologically sophisticated horror and his unusual hardboiled crime. Tremblay's complex horror tales often revolve around demonic possession and supernatural transformation, usually within the framework of a reasonably normal family, maintaining a menacing atmosphere and almost unbearable tension. Like his horror, Tremblay's crime fiction is also psychologically nuanced, featuring unusual variations on the detective genre, particularly notable in his creation of what is probably the first narcoleptic private eye. Regardless of the genre, though, Tremblay's writing is stylish, crisp, and slyly humorous.",
