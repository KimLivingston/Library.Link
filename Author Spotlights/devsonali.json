    "description": "Sonali Dev writes multicultural contemporary romances starring spirited young women and handsome, dashing young men, both torn between Indian cultural tradition and modern Western culture. Her likable, well-drawn protagonists believe in true love but are often thwarted by their dark family pasts. Dev presents her mildly sensuous stories with a light touch and an upbeat tone without trivializing Indian customs or mocking the ambitions of smart women intent upon self discovery.",
